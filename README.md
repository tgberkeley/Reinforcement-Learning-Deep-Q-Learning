# Reinforcement-Learning-Deep-Q-Learning

Implemented a deep Q-network to solve randomly generated mazes. The implementation is divided in three files: random_environment.py, train_and_test.py, and agent.py (random_environment.py and train_and_test.py were given)

* random_environment.py creates random mazes - the agent always starts on the left of the maze and the goal is always on the right

* train_and_test.py gets an environment from random_environment.py, trains the agent for 10 minutes, and tests the agent's optimal policy on the maze

* Features implemented in the agent.py file:

  * Double Q-network
Epsilon-greedy policy. Different levels of epsilon decay throughout the training
Episode length variations across the training time
Experience replay buffer
Positions of the obstacles encoded in the reward function by penalizing the agent every time it hits a wall
